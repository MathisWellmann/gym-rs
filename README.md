# OpenAI Gym written in pure Rust for blazingly fast performance

This library aims be be as close to the original OpenAI Gym library which is written in Python
and translate it into Rust for blazingly fast performance.
This will make the use of Python or any wrapper unnecessary which is awesome.


# Contributions are welcome!
If you would like to add an environment or a feature, please fork this repository and create a pull request 
with your changes. Adding new environments should be as easy as translating from Python to Rust. See 
[OpenAI/gym](https://github.com/openai/gym)
for environments that are not yet implemented here! There is alot of easy work to be done here.
Any Help is highly appreciated and benefits the Rust and ML/AI community greatly!

## TODOs:
- write README.md
- manage LICENSE.md
- implement more environments
- extensive documentation
- compare performance to gym-rs python wrapper
- make generic implementation and compare f32 vs f64 performance.
