If you would like to add an environment or a feature, please fork this repository and create a pull request
with your changes. Adding new environments should be as easy as translating from Python to Rust. See
[OpenAI/gym](https://github.com/openai/gym)
for environments that are not yet implemented here! There is a lot of easy work to be done here.
Any help is highly appreciated and benefits the Rust and ML/AI community greatly!
